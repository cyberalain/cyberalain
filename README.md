Passionate about cybersecurity, I thrive on solving complex security challenges through hands-on projects. From vulnerability management and threat detection to incident response and automation, I continuously explore innovative ways to enhance security operations.

 My projects showcase my expertise in threat hunting, risk assessment, and security automation, leveraging tools like Tenable, Microsoft Defender, SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel), PowerShell, and more. Each project reflects my dedication to mitigating cyber threats and strengthening security defenses.
